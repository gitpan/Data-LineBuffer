NAME

    Data::LineBuffer - provide a line oriented data push back facility
                       for input sources

DESCRIPTION

     LineBuffer provides a very rudimentary input push back
     facility.  It provides a layer between the input source and
     the calling routine which allows data to be pushed back onto
     the input source for retrieval, as a last in, first out,
     stack.

     It is only concerned with line-oriented data, and can
     interface with a filehandle, a subroutine (which returns
     data), a string containing multiple lines to be parsed, or
     an array of lines.
